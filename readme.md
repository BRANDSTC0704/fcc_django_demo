## Git Repo Django-App 
# Demo for fcc 

Now there are two apps in the repo: the first one is a demo data entrance app (folder spreadsheet_app)
The app is providing some data entrance functionality linked to a sqlite database. 
The idea is based on data from Thomas Gattringer, provided by Martin Rohringer on 7.3.2025. 

The second app is a data entrance app for Himberg 2 operational data. 
The forms were provided by Franz Aschenbrenner on 14.04.2025. 

Currently, there are 3 apps included: 
- dateneingaben - for data entry forms
- dashboards - for visuals
- darstellungen - for editable list views
